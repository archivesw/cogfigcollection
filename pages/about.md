## CDL bibliography
CDL (Cognitive Decline and Language) presented on this website is a brief display of a value added [bibliography](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/cognitive-decline-and-language-cdl/synopsis/) prepared as background to discussing research on the cognitive neuroscience of language and cognitive decline at [Research Centre for Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/about-centre/our-mission/). 

## CDL website
The website of CDL is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

## Acknowlegement
We thank the faculty librarians at the University of Idaho for their diligent guidance and [The CollectionBuilder-GH Workshop Tutorial](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/workshop/gh/). We also thank Core Devision of American Library Association for its active coordination.
