## CDL bibliography
CDL (Cognitive Decline and Language) presented on this website is a brief visualization of [a value added subject bibliography](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/cognitive-decline-and-language-cdl/synopsis/) including bibliometric data visualization prepared as background to discussing research on the cognitive neuroscience of language and cognitive decline at [Research Centre for Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/rclcn/about-centre/our-mission/). 

## Bibliometrics
The data files below are for [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/) visualization on the topic of "aging and language" of CDL related publications found in the database of [Demensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/). Copy and save the two statistic data files in two seperate note files (.txt files), and then open them by VOSviewer to observe various interactive presentations of related publication names. For more information, visit [VOSviewer: Getting Started](https://youtu.be/9dTWkNRxUtw), [Visual exploration of scientific literature using VOSviewer and CitNetExplorer (7/ 2020)](https://youtu.be/3aSKhFeXIU4), and [Bibliometric Analysis of DIMENSIONS Data Using VosViewer (3/2021)](https://youtu.be/or6LA0anOBQ).
